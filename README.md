A desktop pet that reacts to your AI coding agent sessions in real-time. This project is a Mojocarrot-themed derivative of the public repository [rullerzhou-afk/clawd-on-desk](https://github.com/rullerzhou-afk/clawd-on-desk), adapted into **Mojocarrot on Desk** for WMLS with reworked scene choreography and character-specific animation tuning.

> Supports Windows 11, macOS, and Ubuntu/Linux. Requires Node.js. Works with **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, **Copilot CLI**, **Gemini CLI**, and **Cursor Agent**.

## Features

### Mojocarrot Variant
- **Mojocarrot for WMLS** — this branch replaces the default on-screen character with Mojocarrot while keeping the original multi-agent runtime, permission bubble flow, mini mode, and session logic
- **Retuned animation language** — many scenes now reuse the original Clawd timing as a mother asset, but the acting, face layering, props, and overlays are adjusted for Mojocarrot
- **Layered character assets** — Mojocarrot uses split body / leaves / eyes / mouth / sleep assets instead of a single flat sprite, which makes cursor tracking, sleep transitions, and scene-specific face handling more controllable
- **Credit to the original project** — the runtime architecture, hook model, and core desktop-pet workflow come from the original public `clawd-on-desk` project, while this branch focuses on Mojocarrot-specific assets, animation retiming, and presentation

### Multi-Agent Support
- **Claude Code** — full integration via command hooks + HTTP permission hooks
- **Codex CLI** — automatic JSONL log polling (`~/.codex/sessions/`), no configuration needed
- **Copilot CLI** — command hooks via `~/.copilot/hooks/hooks.json`
- **Gemini CLI** — command hooks via `~/.gemini/settings.json` (registered automatically when Clawd starts, or run `npm run install:gemini-hooks`)
- **Cursor Agent** — [Cursor IDE hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks) in `~/.cursor/hooks.json` (registered automatically when Clawd starts, or run `npm run install:cursor-hooks`)
- **Multi-agent coexistence** — run all agents simultaneously; Mojocarrot tracks each session independently

### Animations & Interaction
- **Real-time state awareness** — agent hooks and log polling drive Clawd's animations automatically
- **Character-specific animation set** — idle, thinking, typing, building, juggling, conducting, error, happy, notification, sweeping, carrying, sleeping, plus mini-mode and click-reaction variants retuned for Mojocarrot
- **Eye tracking** — Mojocarrot follows your cursor in idle state, with body lean and shadow stretch
- **Sleep sequence** — yawning, dozing, collapsing, sleeping after 60s idle; mouse movement triggers a startled wake-up animation
- **Click reactions** — double-click for a poke, 4 clicks for a flail
- **Drag from any state** — grab Mojocarrot anytime (Pointer Capture prevents fast-flick drops), release to resume
- **Mini mode** — drag to right edge or right-click "Mini Mode"; Mojocarrot hides at screen edge with peek-on-hover, mini alerts/celebrations, and parabolic jump transitions

### Permission Bubble
- **In-app permission review** — when Claude Code requests tool permissions, Mojocarrot pops a floating bubble card instead of waiting in the terminal
- **Allow / Deny / Suggestions** — one-click approve, reject, or apply permission rules (e.g. "Always allow Read")
- **Stacking layout** — multiple permission requests stack upward from the bottom-right corner
- **Auto-dismiss** — if you answer in the terminal first, the bubble disappears automatically

### Session Intelligence
- **Multi-session tracking** — sessions across all agents resolve to the highest-priority state
- **Subagent awareness** — juggling for 1 subagent, conducting for 2+
- **Terminal focus** — right-click Mojocarrot → Sessions menu to jump to a specific session's terminal window; notification/attention states auto-focus the relevant terminal
- **Process liveness detection** — detects crashed/exited agent processes (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot) and cleans up orphan sessions
- **Startup recovery** — if Mojocarrot on Desk restarts while any agent is running, it stays awake instead of falling asleep

### System
- **Click-through** — transparent areas pass clicks to windows below; only Clawd's body is interactive
- **Position memory** — Mojocarrot remembers where you left it across restarts (including mini mode)
- **Single instance lock** — prevents duplicate app windows
- **Auto-start** — Claude Code's SessionStart hook can launch Mojocarrot on Desk automatically if it's not running
- **Do Not Disturb** — right-click or tray menu to enter sleep mode; all hook events are silenced until you wake Mojocarrot
- **System tray** — resize (S/M/L), DND mode, language switch, auto-start, check for updates
- **i18n** — English and Chinese UI; switch via right-click menu or tray
- **Auto-update** — checks GitHub releases; Windows installs NSIS updates on quit, macOS opens the release page, Linux requires manual download

## State Mapping

Events from all agents (Claude Code hooks, Codex JSONL, Copilot hooks) map to the same animation states:

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lukelei2025/mojocarrot-on-desk.git
cd mojocarrot-on-desk

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Mojocarrot on Desk (auto-registers Claude Code hooks on launch)
npm start
```

For a fresh local install, this repository can now be treated as a standalone Mojocarrot project. You do not need to install the upstream `clawd-on-desk` repository first.

### Agent Setup

**Claude Code** — works out of the box. Hooks are auto-registered on launch. Versioned hooks (`PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `StopFailure`) are registered only when the app can positively detect a compatible Claude Code version; if detection fails (common for packaged macOS launches), it falls back to core hooks and removes stale incompatible versioned hooks automatically.

**Codex CLI** — works out of the box. Mojocarrot on Desk polls `~/.codex/sessions/` for JSONL logs automatically.

**Copilot CLI** — requires manual hook setup. See [docs/copilot-setup.md](docs/copilot-setup.md) for instructions.

### Remote SSH (Claude Code & Codex CLI)

<img src="assets/screenshot-remote-ssh.png" width="560" alt="Remote SSH — permission bubble from Raspberry Pi">

Mojocarrot on Desk can sense AI agent activity on remote servers via SSH reverse port forwarding. Hook events and permission requests travel through the SSH tunnel back to your local app — no code changes needed on the desktop side.

**One-click deploy:**

```bash
bash scripts/remote-deploy.sh user@remote-host
```

This copies hook files to the remote server, registers Claude Code hooks in remote mode, and prints SSH configuration instructions.

**SSH configuration** (add to your local `~/.ssh/config`):

```
Host my-server
    HostName remote-host
    User user
    RemoteForward 127.0.0.1:23333 127.0.0.1:23333
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

**How it works:**
- **Claude Code** — command hooks on the remote server POST state changes to `localhost:23333`, which the SSH tunnel forwards back to your local Mojocarrot on Desk instance. Permission bubbles work too — the HTTP round-trip goes through the tunnel.
- **Codex CLI** — a standalone log monitor (`codex-remote-monitor.js`) polls JSONL files on the remote server and POSTs state changes through the same tunnel. Start it on the remote: `node ~/.claude/hooks/codex-remote-monitor.js --port 23333`

Remote hooks run in `CLAWD_REMOTE` mode which skips PID collection (remote PIDs are meaningless locally). Terminal focus is not available for remote sessions.

### macOS Notes

- **From source** (`npm start`): works out of the box on Intel and Apple Silicon.
- **DMG installer**: the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, so macOS Gatekeeper will block it. To open:
  - Right-click the app → **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog, or
  - Run `xattr -cr /Applications/Mojocarrot\ on\ Desk.app` in Terminal.

### Linux Notes

- **From source** (`npm start`): `--no-sandbox` is passed automatically to work around chrome-sandbox SUID requirements in dev mode.
- **Packages**: AppImage and `.deb` are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lukelei2025/mojocarrot-on-desk/releases). After deb install, the app icon appears in GNOME's app menu.
- **Terminal focus**: uses `wmctrl` or `xdotool` (whichever is available). Install one for session terminal jumping to work: `sudo apt install wmctrl` or `sudo apt install xdotool`.
- **Auto-update**: not available on Linux — download new versions manually from GitHub Releases.

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| **Codex CLI: no terminal focus** | Codex sessions use JSONL log polling which doesn't carry terminal PID info. Clicking Mojocarrot won't jump to the Codex terminal. Claude Code and Copilot CLI work fine. |
| **Codex CLI: Windows hooks disabled** | Codex hardcodes hooks off on Windows, so we poll log files instead. This means ~1.5s latency vs near-instant for hook-based agents. |
| **Copilot CLI: manual hook setup** | Copilot hooks require manually creating `~/.copilot/hooks/hooks.json`. Claude Code and Codex work out of the box. |
| **Copilot CLI: no permission bubble** | Copilot's `preToolUse` hook only supports deny, not the full allow/deny flow. Permission bubbles only work with Claude Code. |
| **macOS/Linux auto-update** | No Apple code signing on macOS, no auto-update on Linux — download updates manually from GitHub Releases. |
| **No test framework for Electron** | Unit tests cover agents and log polling, but the Electron main process (state machine, windows, tray) has no automated tests. |
